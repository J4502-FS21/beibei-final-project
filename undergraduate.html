    <p id="text-story">
      <span class="paragraf1">2020 is a special year for Xinyi Luo, a Chinese student in Mizzou, who chose to take a gap year due to the COVID-19.</span>

      <span class="paragraf1">Many international students faced the same choice as she did. According to the <a href="https://nscresearchcenter.org/current-term-enrollment-estimates/">National Student Clearinghouse Research Center’s December 2020 report</a>, postsecondary enrollments dropped 2.5% in the 2020 fall, nearly twice the rate of decline from 2019. </span>

      <span class="paragraf1">Financial burden, teaching style, public health crisis… These are all the reasons for students to take a gap year. Usually, multiple reasons led to students’ decisions, just like what Xinyi considered. </span>

      <span class="paragraf1">“It’s not worthwhile taking online courses but paying for the same tuition,” Xinyi said. “I just don’t like online courses because I can’t concentrate.” </span>

      <span class="paragraf1">International students spend much more on tuition here at the University of Missouri. According to Mizzou Admissions, Missouri residents spend around <a href="https://admissions.missouri.edu/costs/">$13,128</a> per year on tuition and fees, while it costs international students around<a href="https://admissions.missouri.edu/international-students/international-costs-scholarships/"> $24,812 per year</a>. </span>

      <span class="paragraf1">Xinyi said she also didn’t have a choice to take an online course too, because the core course in the old curriculum, such as J4804 Convergence Reporting couldn’t be taken online. On the other hand, Xinyi was back home in China and couldn’t fly to the United States because of its travel ban. </span>

      <span class="paragraf1">While being forced to take a gap year, Xinyi also found it to be a relief since she felt somewhat lost at that point. </span>

      <span class="paragraf1">“Gap year allowed me to reconsider my passion and my interest,” Xinyi said. “I was supposed to apply for graduate school that semester, but I felt like I was not ready and was overwhelmed by school.”</span>

      <span class="paragraf1">After making this decision, Xinyi started her internship in China to explore her passion. She worked as a social media intern for Columbia University Global Center in Beijing, and then be a communication intern for China Philanthropy Research Institute. After getting a year of working experience, she finally found her passion, which is political and economic study.</span>

      <span class="paragraf1">“Surprisingly, I was extremely happy in 2020 because I finally got a chance to stop for a while and explore myself,” Xinyi said many people follow a similar life path, in which they keep moving forward but never know what they want. However, the COVID-19 accidentally gave her a break to stop, to think, and to reflect on herself. </span>

      <span class="paragraf1">While some people enjoy their gap year like Xinyi, her experience might not represent most people’s choice. According to <a gref"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/09/many-college-students-chose-time-off-over-remote-learning-during-covid.html"> CNBC</a>, some students were simply burned out from the stress of the pandemic. The family financial crisis, mental health problems are also why students choose to gap. </span>
