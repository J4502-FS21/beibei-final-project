      <span class="paragraf1">Yinting Yu is struggling to find a job in the U.S. As a postgraduate student at Northwest University, she is always rejected by recruiters due to her identity—an international student.</span>

      <span class="paragraf1">The reason is simple: employers need to pay extra money for them. While international students need to apply for H-1B visas to be legally employed, their employers need to pay all the fees of the petition process, and this might cost thousands of dollars per worker.</span>

        <span class="paragraf1">“Even if the recruiter is interested in me, he can’t make the decision,” Yu said, “this can’t be decided by only the hire manager or the hiring department but by the whole company.”</span>

        <span class="paragraf1">Another reason for this dilemma is the chance to get H-1B successfully. Even if international students manage to find an employer willing to pay, it is possible that they still fail to get H1B. The government only grants 65,000 new H-1B visas every year while <a href="https://redbus2us.com/total-h1b-registrations-received-for-fy-2021-is-275k-46-masters/">27 thousand people </a> applied for it this year.</span>

        <span class="paragraf1">While the pandemic led to a much higher unemployment rate and large layoffs, the number of H-1B applications <a href="https://redbus2us.com/total-h1b-registrations-received-for-fy-2021-is-275k-46-masters/">increases 44.6% </a> from 2019. The chance of getting it is smaller, so employers worry about wasting time on workers forced to leave the U.S without H-1B.</span>

        <span class="paragraf1">“It was super hard to find a job last year because of the economical recession, but many people say ‘job market is crazy now’ because the job market is recovering from the COVID-19” Yu said. Even though, international students still face limited choices to stay in the U.S.</span>

        <span class="paragraf1">COVID-19 sent the U.S market on a roller coaster ride, people lost jobs and regain jobs in the last 19 months. However, it is never easy for international students to find jobs and stay here. The unemployment rate for foreign-born persons in the United States was 9.2 percent 2020, up sharply from 3.1 percent in 2019, the U.S. <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/forbrn.pdf">Bureau of Labor Statistics reported</a>.</span>

        <span class="paragraf1">Yu got her first offer from a Singapore company, and she will move to Singapore if no job is offered to her in the U.S.</span>
