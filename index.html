      <h2 class="rate">Unemployment Rate</h2>
      <p>The major hike in unemployment in North America in 2020 does not fully account for the employment impact of the crisis because of (a) the decline in labour force participation, and (b) increases in other forms of labour underutilization. The unemployment rate increased by 4.5 percentage points, equivalent to around 8 million additional unemployed people in 2020</p>
